## Task5
Fibonacci Sequence 

## Instructions
To run the code, execute the `main` class.
## Task Description
Create a PHP function (Laravel way) that generates a Fibonacci sequence of a specified length. Explain whether you would use recursion or iteration for this task, and provide your implementation.

### Answer:
I used the iterative approach to generate the Fibonacci sequence because iteration has better time complexity and is less likely to produce errors compared to recursion. 

Please note that the Laravel implementation is beyond my current skill level, but I would be more than happy to learn it if I had more time.
